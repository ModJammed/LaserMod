# LaserMod

This mod was coded by [ProPercivalalb](http://www.minecraftforum.net/members/ProPercivalalb) (post can be found [here](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1293056)</a>) for <i>Modjam 3</i>. The author has stopped updating the 'original' mod and merged both the old LaserMod (coded by [Webmilio](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1286858)**). The current itteration of the [LaserMod](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1293056) was coded from scratch by [ProPercivalalb](http://www.minecraftforum.net/members/ProPercivalalb).

** The original LaserMod was coded by [w3cr4ft](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1275658),  [Pigbear](http://www.minecraftforum.net/members/Pigbear) and [mantis.88](http://www.minecraftforum.net/members/MCFUser591794). They have given their permission to <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/members/webmilio">Webmilio</a> to continue the mod, who in turn gave the permissions to <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/members/ProPercivalalb">ProPercivalalb</a> to use the assets and code of the original mod.
